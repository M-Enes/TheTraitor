# Battery Simulation Project

## Assignment Summary
This project implements a C++ object-oriented simulation for batteries and battery packs. It consists of a base `Battery` class and a derived `BatteryPack` class. The program models real-world battery behaviors, including discharging and recharging logic, and calculates total voltage, capacity, and charge based on **Series** or **Parallel** connection types.

## File List & Status

- [x] **Battery.h**: Header file for the base class.
- [x] **Battery.cpp**: Implementation of the base class.
- [x] **BatteryPack.h**: Header file for the derived class.
- [x] **BatteryPack.h (Doxygen)**: Adding Doxygen-style comments.
- [x] **BatteryPack.cpp**: Implementation of the derived class logic.
- [ ] **BatteryTest.cpp**: Main file for testing the simulation. We can add more test methods in this class
