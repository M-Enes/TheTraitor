## How to Build

### On Linux
#### If you are using VS Code
Just install C/C++ Extension Pack and CMake Tools. \
When you open the project folder with VS Code, CMake Tools extension will automatically config the build system for you. \
Press Ctrl + Shift + P, write CMake:Debug and you are ready.
#### If you are not using VS Code
Open a terminal in the projects root directory. \
Run `mkdir build`. \
Run `cd build`. \
Run `cmake ..`.

### On Windows
Open the project folder in Visual Studio and it will configure everything for you.
